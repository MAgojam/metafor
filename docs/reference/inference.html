The former term is (mostly) avoided throughout the package documentation. The term &amp;#8216;equal-effects model&amp;#8217; is used instead, since it more concretely describes the main assumption underlying this model (i.e., that the underlying true effects/outcomes are homogeneous, that is, all equal to each other). The term &amp;#8216;common-effects model&amp;#8217; has also sometimes been used in the literature to describe this model and is equally descriptive.
Moreover, the term &amp;#8216;fixed-effects model&amp;#8217; creates a bit of a conundrum. When authors use this term, they are really typically referring to the equal-effects model. There is however another type of model, the &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; fixed-effects model, that is different from the equal-effects model, but now we would need to invent (unnecessarily) a different term to refer to this model. Some have done so or tried to make a distinction between the &amp;#8216;fixed-effect model&amp;#8217; (without the s!) and the &amp;#8216;fixed-effects model&amp;#8217;, but this subtle difference in terminology is easily overlooked/missed. Using the term &amp;#8216;equal-effects model&amp;#8217; avoids this confusion.
However, the question then remains what the real fixed-effects model is all about. The purpose of this page is to describe this model and to contrast it with the well-known random-effects model.
Assume we have a set of \(i = 1, \ldots, k\) independent studies and let \(y_i\) denote the observed value of the effect size or outcome measure in the \(i\textrm{th}\) study. Let \(\theta_i\) denote the corresponding (unknown) true effect/outcome, such that \[y_i | \theta_i \sim N(\theta_i, v_i).\] In other words, the observed effect sizes or outcomes are assumed to be unbiased and normally distributed estimates of the corresponding true effects/outcomes with sampling variances equal to \(v_i\). The \(v_i\) values are assumed to be known.
The fixed-effects model conditions on the true effects/outcomes and therefore provides a conditional inference about the \(k\) studies included in the meta-analysis. When using weighted estimation, this implies that the fitted model provides an estimate of \[\bar{\theta}_w = \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \theta_i / \sum_{i=1}^k w_i,\] that is, the weighted average of the true effects/outcomes in the \(k\) studies, with weights equal to \(w_i = 1/v_i\). One can also employ an unweighted estimation method, which provides an estimate of the unweighted average of the true effects/outcomes in \(k\) studies, that is, an estimate of \[\bar{\theta}_u = \sum_{i=1}^k \theta_i / k.\]
For weighted estimation, one could also choose to estimate \(\bar{\theta}_w\), where the \(w_i\) values are user-defined weights (inverse-variance weights or unit weights as in unweighted estimation are just special cases). It is up to the user to decide to what extent \(\bar{\theta}_w\) is a meaningful parameter to estimate (regardless of the weights used).
The random-effects model does not condition on the true effects/outcomes. Instead, the \(k\) studies included in the meta-analysis are assumed to be a random sample from a larger population of studies. In rare cases, the studies included in a meta-analysis are actually sampled from a larger collection of studies. More typically, the population of studies is a hypothetical population of an essentially infinite set of studies comprising all of the studies that have been conducted, that could have been conducted, or that may be conducted in the future. We assume that \(\theta_i \sim N(\mu, \tau^2)\), that is, the true effects/outcomes in the population of studies are normally distributed with \(\mu\) denoting the average true effect/outcome and \(\tau^2\) the variance of the true effects/outcomes in the population (\(\tau^2\) is therefore often referred to as the amount of &amp;#8216;heterogeneity&amp;#8217; in the true effects/outcomes). The random-effects model can also be written as \[y_i = \mu + u_i + \epsilon_i,\] where \(u_i \sim N(0, \tau^2)\) and \(\epsilon_i \sim N(0, v_i)\). The fitted model provides estimates of \(\mu\) and \(\tau^2\). Consequently, the random-effects model provides an unconditional inference about the average true effect/outcome in the population of studies (from which the \(k\) studies included in the meta-analysis are assumed to be a random sample).
When using weighted estimation in the context of a random-effects model, the model is fitted with weights equal to \(w_i = 1/(\tau^2 + v_i)\), with \(\tau^2\) replaced by its estimate. One can also choose unweighted estimation in the context of the random-effects model or specify user-defined weights, although the parameter that is estimated (i.e., \(\mu\)) remains the same regardless of the estimation method and weights used (as opposed to the fixed-effect model, where the parameter estimated is different for weighted versus unweighted estimation or when using different weights than the standard inverse-variance weights). Since weighted estimation with inverse-variance weights is most efficient, it is usually to be preferred for random-effects models (while in the fixed-effect model case, we must carefully consider whether \(\bar{\theta}_w\) or \(\bar{\theta}_u\) is the more meaningful parameter to estimate).
Contrary to what is often stated in the literature, it is important to realize that the fixed-effects model does not assume that the true effects/outcomes are homogeneous (i.e., that \(\theta_i\) is equal to some common value \(\theta\) in all \(k\) studies). In other words, the fixed-effects model provides perfectly valid inferences under heterogeneity, as long as one is restricting these inferences to the set of studies included in the meta-analysis and one realizes that the model does not provide an estimate of \(\theta\), but of \(\bar{\theta}_w\) or \(\bar{\theta}_u\) (depending on the estimation method).
In the special case that the true effects/outcomes are actually homogeneous (the equal-effects case), the distinction between fixed- and random-effects models disappears, since homogeneity implies that \(\mu = \bar{\theta}_w = \bar{\theta}_u \equiv \theta\). However, since there is no infallible method to test whether the true effects/outcomes are really homogeneous or not, a researcher should decide on the type of inference desired before examining the data and choose the model accordingly. In fact, there is nothing wrong with fitting both the fixed- and random-effects models to the same data, since these models address different questions (i.e., what was the average effect in the studies that have been conducted and included in this meta-analysis versus what is the average effect in the larger population of studies?).
