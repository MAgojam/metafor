**This is not a support forum**. General questions about the use of the metafor package should not be asked here, but on the `r-sig-meta-analysis` mailing list (https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-meta-analysis). Anything posted here should really be related to the *development* of the package (including potential bug reports).

## Summary

Summary of the problem.

## Reproducible Example (if applicable)

If applicable, please provide a minimal and fully reproducible example. Remove any superfluous code that is not pertinent to the issue at hand and provide a small dataset together with the code so that it can actually be run (the `dput()` function is extremely useful for this; or use one of the datasets that comes with the metafor package).
